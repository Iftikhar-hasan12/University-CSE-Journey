# üì∂ Signal Simulator - Data Communication Lab Project

A Java Swing-based application that simulates digital signal encoding techniques and visualizes their corresponding waveform transmission. This project demonstrates how binary data is encoded using various encoding algorithms and animated as square waveforms, making it easier to understand the signal transmission in digital communication systems.



## üß† Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to **simulate and visualize digital signal transmission** using different encoding algorithms. It converts user input text into binary, then encodes it using a selected algorithm and finally visualizes it through animated square waveforms.



## üéØ Features

- ‚úÖ **Text to Binary Conversion**
- ‚úÖ **Encoding Algorithms Implemented**:
  - NRZ-L (Non-Return to Zero-Level)
  - NRZ-I (Non-Return to Zero-Inverted)
  - Manchester Standard
  - Manchester Differential
  - Bit Stuffing
- ‚úÖ **Waveform Visualization**
  - Displays waveform for the encoded binary data
  - Step-by-step transmission animation
- ‚úÖ **User-Friendly Java Swing GUI**



## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

You can directly run the project in **NetBeans** using the ZIP file available in this repository.

### Steps:

1. Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
2. **Do not extract** the ZIP file.
3. Open **NetBeans IDE**.
4. Go to `File` ‚Üí `Import Project` ‚Üí `From ZIP...`.
5. Browse and select the downloaded ZIP file.
6. NetBeans will automatically recognize and import the full project.
7. Once imported, right-click on the project and click `Run`.

‚úÖ That's it! The application will launch and you can start experimenting with signal simulations.


## üí° How It Works

1. **Input**: User enters a string, e.g., `hello world`.
2. **Binary Conversion**: The string is converted into binary (ASCII based).
3. **Encoding Selection**: User selects one of the encoding algorithms (e.g., NRZ-I).
4. **Encoding**: The binary data is encoded according to the chosen algorithm.
5. **Waveform Generation**: A waveform is drawn based on the encoded signal.
6. **Animation**: Signal transmission is animated to demonstrate real-time data flow.
